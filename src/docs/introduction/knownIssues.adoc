=== Known Issues
* It is currently not possible to do certain types of criteria query with DateTime properties mapped using PersistentLocalDateTimeWithZone (or any other multi-column Hibernate UserType). Aggregate functions (max, min, avg, count, etc.) in projections will not work on such properties and neither will the 'between' criterion.
* Data binding to properties of embedded types does not work correctly (see http://jira.grails.org/browse/GPJODATIME-21[GPJODATIME-21]).
