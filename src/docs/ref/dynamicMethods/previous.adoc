[[previous]]
=== previous

==== Purpose

Decrements a `ReadableInstant` or `ReadablePartial` instance allowing use in Groovy ranges.

==== Examples

[source,groovy]
----
def today = new LocalDate()
assert today.previous() == today.minusDays(1)
----

==== Description

The increment is generally 1 day for compatibility with the `previous` method Groovy adds to `java.util.Date` however since not all `ReadablePartial` implementations support days the following exceptions exist:

* `org.joda.time.LocalTime` and `org.joda.time.TimeOfDay` decrement by hours.
* `org.joda.time.YearMonth` decrements by months.
